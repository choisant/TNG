\subsection{Stellar-to-halo-mass relation}

//Stellar mass in TNG for different galaxy size definitions

//Comparing SHMR of SAMI and TNG


\subsection{Mass-size-velocity relations}

//Effective radius
First look at different definitons of half-mass radius for TNG for the different galaxy types.
Then compare mass-size relation against SAMI.

//Velocity dispersion
What is the difference in velocity dispersions in whole volume for gas, DM and stars?
Look at velocity dispersion within different radius. 
Comparing against SAMI for both gas and stars for the different galaxy types.

///Fundamental plane/FJ
Show the FP relations for SAMI and TNG-SUBFIND and TNG-particles, early type only.

//Rotational velocity
How flat is the velocity curve for TNG? Compare V-max to V at some other radii.

///TFR
Compare TFR for SAMI and TNG.

\subsection{Color bimodality}

Look at PDF for different band widths for whole subhalo (SUBFIND) and for smaller galaxy sizes (particles).
Compare color-mass diagram against SAMI.
Compare PDF against sami for g-i color.
