In this section, the results of the analysis of the galaxy properties in TNG is presented, along with comparisons to observational data.

\subsection{Stellar-to-halo-mass relation}

The first relation that is studied is the stellar-to-halo-mass relation. It is one of the most fundamental relations that a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation should reproduce, as it ensures that we have the right distribution of halos and galaxies in our mock universe. This relation depends sensitively on the stellar mass content in the galaxy sample, and as such on the stellar mass definition used. The results for the fractional difference in stellar mass measurements for different definitions of galaxy radius are presented in Figure \ref{SM_fSM}. The most obvious result is the significant difference between $M^{SF}$ and $M_\ast^{2rhm}$, with the latter being at least 20 \% smaller for all stellar masses. $M_\ast^{15r200}$ and $M_\ast^{30kpc}$ are essentially indistinguishable from the SUBFIND values at masses below $10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$. For more massive galaxies there is an increasingly large difference between the two as well as compared to SUBFIND. At the higher mass end ($M^{SF}_\ast > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), $M_\ast^{15r200}$ is about 10-15 \% smaller than SUBFIND, $M_\ast^{30kpc}$ is 12-40 \% smaller while $M_\ast^{2rhm}$ is approximately 30 \% smaller.


The reason that we get this difference in stellar mass using different apertures is of course that we are ``cutting off'' the continous stellar particle distribution in the halo. For large, diffuse galaxies, the effect will be most pronounced, and this is what we are indeed finding. A direct comparison of stellar masses found in galaxies between TNG and some other study would therefore be significantly affected by the choice of how stellar mass is defined. This is one of the reasons why galaxy properties are not directly comparable and we have to look at the trends in the properties rather than the exact values. However, this might also affect property relations, depending on how other properties are calculated. It is therefore interesting to see if other galaxy properties have a similar dependency on galaxy size definitions.

    \label{SM_fSM}
\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{shmr} the SHM relation is shown for the different definitions of stellar mass in TNG ($M_\ast^{15r200}$ is left out to make the figure more readable) along with the best fits from \textcite{Behroozi2013} and \textcite{Zanisi2019}. By using the 30 kpc aperture when calculating the stellar mass for TNG galaxies, the results are more similar to the most recent observations. $M_\ast^{2rhm}$ deviates the most from the slope of the observational data, neither matching the low nor high mass end. This showcases the importance of making it clear which stellar mass definition was chosen, as they do give different results in the SHM relation. However, all the different definitions explored here overestimate the stellar mass compared to observations when looking at the very largest galaxies, even the 30 kpc aperture that undoubtely will be too small for the largest galaxies. Comparing with the newer observational data makes the difference much smaller, and within the error estimates, but it should still be considered whether the feedback mechanisms implemented in TNG tend to give the largest galaxies too much stellar mass.

The diamond markers indicate median points and include error bars showing the 25-75 percentile.

    \label{shmr}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, the stellar masses of TNG galaxies are highly dependent upon the imposed galaxy size limit or lack there of. Compared to observations TNG produces galaxies that are similar in mass for low mass galaxies, but seem to overshoot in the high mass limit.

\subsection{Mass-size-velocity relations}
After looking at the SHM relation, the next fundamental galaxy relations that were studied are those relating to the structure and kinematics of the galaxies. Firstly the stellar mass-size relation gives us an idea about the distribution of the stellar mass within the subhalo. The relation is studied for the entire galaxy population as well as for early and late type galaxies. Next, the velocity measurements of early and late type galaxies as functions of stellar mass give insight into the total mass distribution in the subhalos. Specifically the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relation are studied and the TNG data are compared against observations.

\subsubsection{Size}
The half-mass radius will of course be affected by the definition of stellar mass, as it is defined as the radius within which half the stellar mass of the galaxy is found. This can be seen in Figure \ref{SM_R_TNG} in which the stellar half-mass radius and the projected half-mass radius is plotted for different galaxy size definitions. There is a large scatter in this function, and the resulting trends lie within the 25-75 percentile of each other. However, it is still clear that there is a difference in the slope of the relation for the $M_\ast > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ regime. $r^{SF}_{hm}$ is larger than $r^{15r200}_{hm}$ by up to 0.1 dex and larger than $r^{30kpc}_{hm}$ by up to 0.2 dex for the most massive galaxies. 

 It is also interesting to compare the two methods of calculating projected 2D half-mass radii. The only possible method using the SUBFIND catalog is to use the approximate relation $R_{e} \approx 3/4 \times r_{e}$. When using the particles, one can project the galaxies in three orthogonal directions and calculate the average 2D half-mass radius. The results show that multiplying by a factor of $3/4$ is an excellent approximation to the projected stellar half-mass radius.

In Figure \ref{SM_R}, the TNG projected half mass radii for the entire galaxy sample is compared against the data from the SAMI survey. The TNG simulation produces galaxies with half-mass radii that are slightly larger than the SAMI effective radii at lower stellar masses. At high stellar masses the SUBFIND values are higher than those of the fixed aperture of 30 kpc and is a better fit for the SÃ¨rsic-fit effective radius observational data, while $R_{hm}^{30kpc}$ is a better fit for the $R_{e, mge}$ values. TNG galaxies also show a flat or negative slope in the mass range $10^{9.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{10.5} M_{_\odot}$, while the SAMI data has a positive slope such that more massive galaxies have increasingly larger radii across the mass spectrum. This tells us that TNG galaxies become more dense as they grow in size compared to observations, until they reach the characteristic stellar mass $M_\ast = M^{10.5}_{\odot}$, where they again start to expand with increasing mass. It is important to note that there is a large scatter in both observation and simulation results as well as uncertainities which are not accounted for in this study. Keeping this in mind, the similarity in the stellar mass - effective radius relation between observations and TNG is remarkable. 


The stellar mass-size relation for early and late type galaxies is shown in Figure \ref{SM_R_earlies} and Figure \ref{SM_R_lates} respectively. The half-mass radii for late type galaxies are larger than for early types with similar mass, as expected. The relation is sensitively dependent on the criteria used in morphology classifications. In Figure \ref{SM_R_earlies} the SAMI early type galaxies show different behaviours for different morphology classifications in the low mass range. Including the S0 galaxies smoothes out the curve. The galaxy sample is very small in this range though, so this might just be statistical deviations in the mean values. For TNG, the relation does not change significantly based on whether or not the $\kappa_{rot}$ criteria is used. 
For late type galaxies however (Figure \ref{SM_R_lates}) there is a big difference in TNG data. The galaxy sizes of the least massive galaxies increase when the $\kappa_{rot}$ criteria is added. For SAMI data the opposite happens when ``early spirals'' are included in the late type category, the size goes down. This is expected, as more spherical galaxies are smaller than disk-shaped galaxies. Thus, the SAMI ``early + late spirals'' and the TNG $\log(sSFR) > -1.44$ sample are the most similar in the late type size-mass relation. For the early type size-mass relation, the TNG morphology criteria does not matter, but the ``elliptical + S0'' SAMI sample matches better the TNG data.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Rotational velocity}
As the SUBFIND catalog value for rotational velocity is the maximum of the spherically averaged rotation curve, it was interesting to see if the rotational velocities are significantly smaller at specific radii where observational measurements are made. To test this, the rotational velocity was calculated at a distance of $2.2 \times r_{hm}$. There was no difference in the produced data. At that distance the velocity curve is well into the flat regime caused by the dark matter halo, and so this shows that the maximum rotational velocity is not much different from the flat part.

In Figure \ref{TFR} the Tully-Fisher relation is shown for TNG, along with the best-fit from the SAMI data by \textcite{Bloom2017} and \textcite{Bekerait2016} who calculated their velocities at $2.2 \times R_e$ and at the radius within 83\% of the light is contained respectively. Both measurements are within the flattened part of the velocity curve, and so they should be comparable. The TNG data is calculated using a galaxy size of 30 kpc and rotational velocities measured at $2.2 \times r_{hm}^{30kpc}$. The SAMI data has a steeper slope than the TNG data, being 0.31 $\pm 0.1$ and 0.25 respectively. The CALIFA study has a slope of 0.27 $\pm 0.13$, but a lower zero point, and so the TNG results lie between the CALIFA and SAMI fits for $M_\ast > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$. As late type galaxies generally do not exceed $M_\ast = 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, we do not expect to see any difference in the TFR for stellar mass definitions $M_\ast^{15r200}$ or $M_\ast^{SF}$ compared to $M_\ast^{30kpc}$. Using the stellar mass measurement within $2 \times r_{hm}^{SF}$ would decrease the slope further, making for an even worse fit to the observational data. The SAMI fit is based on a sample of galaxies that span a mass range of $10^{7.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, but the TFR extends across the stellar range, with a higher scatter at low stellar masses, so it is still comparable to the TNG data which only spans a range of about $10^{9.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{11} M_{\odot}$.

    \label{TFR}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Velocity dispersion}
To investigate the difference between using the particles and the SUBFIND catalog for velocity dispersion estimates, several aspects of how velocity dispersion is calculated must be considered. The SUBFIND value is the mass averaged velocity dispersion of all particles that are bound to the subhalo ($\sigma^{SF}$), and is the only velocity dispersion measurement found in the group catalog. The velocity dispersion measured observationally is either that of stars or that of gas, so using this total velocity dispersion might not give comparable results. In Figure \ref{VD_part} the contribution to $\sigma^{SF}$ by stellar, gas and dark matter particles are presented. $\sigma^{SF}$ is the mass averaged sum of these values, and is higher than the baryonic (gas and stars) velocity dispersions because of the contribution by the dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the subhalo. Gas velocity dispersion is lower than $\sigma^{SF}$ by more than 30 \%, and reaching 45 \% in the highest mass galaxies. Thus, using $\sigma^{SF}$ as a proxy for $\sigma_{gas}$ is not advisable. The stellar velocity dispersion is much closer to $\sigma^{SF}$, being approximately equal up to the very largest galaxies where it is less than 10 \% smaller. It is still not ideal to use the SUBFIND values, and this is a good argument for why it is important to use the particles for these kinds of analysis.

Looking further at the stellar velocity dispersion in TNG, the effect of a limit on the galaxy size was studied. This is because it might be assumed that velocity dispersion will fall off in the outer parts of the galaxy, and be higher closer to the center. The results show that there is little to no difference in velocity dispersion values for stellar particles within $0.15 \times r_{200}$ or within 30 kpc compared to the entire subhalo. Observational values are often averaged within $r_e$, so this was also done for TNG, yielding slightly smaller velocities at the high mass end. The projection effect was also studied by calculating the projected velocity dispersion in three orthogonal directions and comparing it to scaling the 3D velocity dispersion by a factor of $1/\sqrt{3}$. The difference was neglible, as expected for the elliptical early type galaxies.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/VD_particles.png}
    \caption{Velocity dispersion plotted as function of mass for particles bound to TNG subhalos as identified by SUBFIND. Median values with 25-75 percentile error bars are shown for dark matter (blue circles), stellar particles (orange stars) and gas cells (green diamonds).}
    \label{VD_part}
\end{figure}

The Faber-Jackson relation for early type galaxies is shown in Figure \ref{FJ}. We get lower velocity dispersion in TNG compared to SAMI, by about 0.05 - 0.15 dex. It is tempting to contribute the discrepancy to the difference in stellar mass, however by looking at the SHMR relation in Figure \ref{shmr} we see that the mass deviates from observations at around $10^{11} M_{\odot}$, while in Figure \ref{FJ} the difference starts much earlier. Also, the mass is only off from the observations by about 0.1-0.2 dex, but starting at $10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$ the difference from SAMI in the Faber-Jackson relation is larger, up to 0.4 dex at the highest masses. From this, it would seem that velocity dispersions in TNG are lower than those seen in observations at redshift $z=0$. Based on the above analysis, it does not seem like this can be attributed to projection effects or the size of the volume within the velocity dispersion is calculated, but rather the velocities of the simulated stellar particles are in general lower than that which is observed in the stars of real elliptical galaxies.

    \label{FJ}
\end{figure}

All in all, the mass-size-velocity relations of TNG studied here all show the expected trends found in observational data, but there are some discrepancies especially with the most massive galaxies.

\subsection{Color bimodality}
The final galaxy property which was studied is the color bimodality. Color bimodality is an important feature of observed galaxies, and it has been well documented to be present in TNG galaxies as well \parencite{Nelson2017}. Firstly, the sensitivity to aperture sizes of the g-i color measurements was checked, and there was no apparent difference in the results. This is expected, as the g-i color measures the color of the light that is coming from stars. The larger galaxies, which are the most affected by a limiting aperture, are made up of old stars with very little star formation going on regardless of which part of the galaxy is inspected. The results presented in this section are therefore those measured within the 30 kpc aperture, as those stellar masses are closer to the observed values in the SHMR. It is also important to mention here that SAMI data contains satellite galaxies as well as centrals, so they will be more affected by environment than TNG galaxies.

The color-mass diagram of the entire galaxy population with $M_\ast > 10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$ for the two data sets is presented in Figure \ref{CB}. The separation into two higher density regions in the blue and red end of the spectrum is obvious for TNG. In SAMI, the separation is less obvious. There is a defined red group, but the blue galaxies are much more spread out compared to TNG. This could suggest that TNG actually produces galaxies that are too well separated into red and blue groups. Also, in observations the galaxies tend to get more red as they increase in size, but this slope is much shallower in TNG galaxies. This is also mentioned by \textcite{Nelson2017}, who interestingly suggests that this is due to their choice of a 30 kpc aperture which excludes parts of the larger galaxies. This turns out to not be the case as mentioned earlier. Their other suggested solution was that there is a discrepancy in the relatively simple TNG dust modeling. 

In Figure \ref{CB_PDF} the PDF for the g-i colors in early and late type galaxies in TNG and SAMI are shown. The height of the peaks are not comparable, but the distribution and peaks of the color of galaxies are remarkably similar. There is a slight shift towards bluer colors for the peaks in the populations of TNG by about 0.05-0.1 mag compared to SAMI, reflecting the missing upwards trend in the color-mass diagram. 

To sum up, the TNG galaxies show a clear color bimodality in its galaxy population. However, the separation may actually be too binary, as the observations show a more complex picture.
